Codecademy.com project #20; data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. 

Codecademy.com description of project:
"For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.
You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any 
patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. 
During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in 
a meaningful way.
After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings about the National Park Service."

How to view this project: 
I was provided with two datasets: 
1. observations.csv contains species counts in four national parks. 
2. species_fino.csv contains species information, including conservation status

biodiversity.ipynb is the file I used to inspect, clean, and visualize the data.

Practice Data Analysis Report is a rough draft for how I might present my findings to others.
